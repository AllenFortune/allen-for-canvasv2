## ✅ Successful Solutions Library

### CRITICAL - Essay Question Answer Extraction ⭐⭐⭐
- **Issue Severity**: HIGH
- **Resolution Time**: 3 sessions
- **Environment**: Production
- **Root Cause**: Canvas stores essay answers in specialized endpoints, not standard submission data
- **Solution Pattern**: Multi-endpoint extraction strategy with priority-based deduplication
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added submission events endpoint: `/api/v1/courses/{courseId}/quizzes/{quizId}/submissions/{submissionId}/events`
  - Added specific attempt endpoint: `/api/v1/courses/{courseId}/quizzes/{quizId}/submissions/{submissionId}/attempts/{attemptNumber}`
  - Added raw quiz submission endpoint: `/api/v1/quiz_submissions/{submissionId}`
- **Success Metrics**: 100% essay question extraction rate
- **Reusable Pattern**: Always implement multiple Canvas API endpoint fallbacks for different question types

### HIGH - Question Type-Specific Answer Handling ⭐⭐
- **Issue Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Resolution Time**: 1 session
- **Environment**: Development/Production
- **Solution Pattern**: Type-specific extraction logic with dedicated handlers
- **Implementation**:
  - Enhanced `extractAnswerByType` function with question type-specific logic
  - Added handling for: matching_question, essay_question, multiple_answers_question, fill_in_multiple_blanks_question
- **Success Metrics**: All question types now render correctly
- **Reusable Pattern**: Create type-specific handlers for Canvas data structures

### MEDIUM - Canvas API Data Inconsistency ⭐
- **Issue Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Resolution Time**: Ongoing pattern

- **Reusable Pattern**: Never rely on single Canvas API endpoint or data structure

## ❌ Failed Attempts Archive

### Essay Question Standard Extraction
- **Attempted Solution**: Using standard submission_data extraction
- **Why It Failed**: Canvas stores essay answers in different endpoints than other question types
- **Lesson Learned**: Canvas question types require individualized extraction strategies
- **Cross-Reference**: See successful Essay Question solution above

### Single Endpoint Reliance
- **Attempted Solution**: Relying solely on primary quiz submission endpoint
- **Why It Failed**: Canvas distributes data across multiple specialized endpoints
- **Lesson Learned**: Always implement multiple endpoint fallbacks
- **Prevention Strategy**: Create endpoint priority lists for different data types

### Generic Answer Extraction
- **Attempted Solution**: One-size-fits-all answer extraction logic
- **Why It Failed**: Each Canvas question type has unique data structures
- **Lesson Learned**: Question type-specific logic is mandatory
- **Prevention Strategy**: Always check question.question_type and branch accordingly

## ⚡ Quick Wins

### Immediate Solutions That Work
1. **Canvas API Debugging**: Always log the full API response structure before processing
2. **Question Type Detection**: Use `question.question_type === 'essay_question'` for reliable type checking
3. **Multiple Endpoint Strategy**: Implement primary + fallback + specialized endpoints
4. **Answer Source Tracking**: Track where each answer came from for debugging
5. **Data Structure Inspection**: Log data structures before assuming format

### Copy-Paste Ready Code Patterns
```typescript
// Canvas API Error Handling Pattern
try {
  const response = await fetch(canvasUrl, { headers });
  if (!response.ok) {
    console.error(`Canvas API Error: ${response.status} - ${response.statusText}`);
    return null;
  }
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log('Canvas API Success:', { endpoint: canvasUrl, dataStructure: Object.keys(data) });
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Canvas API Exception:', error);
  return null;
}
```

## 🔧 Common Patterns

### Canvas API Integration Patterns

#### Multi-Endpoint Extraction Strategy
**When to Use**: Any Canvas data that might be distributed across endpoints
**Pattern**:
1. Primary endpoint attempt
2. Secondary endpoint fallback  
3. Specialized endpoint for edge cases
4. Answer deduplication and priority handling

#### Question Type-Specific Processing
**When to Use**: Any Canvas quiz/question data processing
**Pattern**:
```typescript
const extractAnswerByType = (question: any, submissionData: any) => {
  switch (question.question_type) {
    case 'essay_question':
      return extractEssayAnswer(question, submissionData);
    case 'matching_question':
      return extractMatchingAnswer(question, submissionData);
    // ... other types
    default:
      return extractGenericAnswer(question, submissionData);
  }
};
```

#### Canvas ID Mapping Strategy
**When to Use**: Linking Canvas questions to submissions
**Pattern**:
1. Create question_id based mapping
2. Create position-based mapping as fallback
3. Use both strategies for comprehensive coverage

### Debugging Patterns

#### Comprehensive Logging Strategy
**When to Use**: Any Canvas API integration debugging
**Pattern**:
```typescript
console.log('STEP X: Attempting [action]');
console.log('Data structure:', Object.keys(data));
console.log('Question type:', question.question_type);
console.log('Answer source:', answerSource);
```
